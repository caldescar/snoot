      <p>You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)</p>
      <p>Oh, but you never died!</p>
      <p>Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs</p>
      <p>Synthesizing heart and soul</p>
      <p>Ain't no cemetary you can't shed (Oh no)</p>
      <p>Ain't nowhere you can hide!</p>
      <p>Don't be frightened of us</p>
      <p>Soon enough you're gonna love us, just remember</p>
