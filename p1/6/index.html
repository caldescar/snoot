      <p>You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
Oh, but you never died!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Ain't no cemetary you can't shed (Oh no)
Ain't nowhere you can hide!
Don't be frightened of us
Soon enough you're gonna love us, just remember</p>
