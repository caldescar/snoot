    I got a dog named Luke Carroll. He is an absolute rascal and scoundrel of a dog. I love him so much. We got him when he was only about 3-4 months old. We were his fourth home, which was surprising to us because he is one of the sweetest, cutest dogs ever. However, he is not without his own quirks, which I am more than happy to talk about.

    Lukey pookie is a golden retriever, german shepherd, austrailian shepherd mix. He looks a lot like a lab-- we don't know why. He's well over 70 pounds, and is still growing. He is very smart for a dog, but in no way, shape, or form obedient. We spent a good amount of money on getting him trained. He can sit, heel, not bite, not jump, the works. However, Luke will only do any of that if he knows that there's something in it for him. If he knows he's not going to get a treat for sitting or not jumping, he'll do it anyways.

    Luke is also very protective, which my mom believes to be the shepherd in him. He wants to know where everyone in the house is at all times. He won't rest unless mymom, my sister, and I are all in the same room. If someone's upstairs in the bathroom, you know he's going to ram his whole body into the door to get in.

    Along with being protective, he was raised with just women, so he absolutely HATES when men come into the house. He loses his mind over men in the house, no matter who it is. In public and at the dog park, he's an angel. He's never bitten or barked at anyone. In the house, he will bark up a storm if someone he doesn't like is in his territory.

    If Luke does like you, though, he is not afraid to show it. He believes that he is a lapdog, and even at 70+ pounds, he is absolutely right. He will sit directly on your lap with a chew toy and play with that while you watch TV. Occasionally, he'll get sleepy and decide to take a nap right on your legs. It's probably the best feeling in the world, even with the dead legs. Because he's still a puppy, he sleeps all the time and all over the place. He's a very affectionate doggie. His main goal in his life is to love a whole lot.

    If his first goal is to love with his entire heart, his second goal is to test your love to him by doing the most obnoxious stuff anyone has ever seen a dog do. He refuses to close his mouth when he's done drinking water, so he leaves big puddles all over the kitchen floor and tracks water across the house. He will eat anything that is small and cloth-like in texture. Since he wants to know what everyone in the house is doing at once, he'll bark outside the door until you let him in, only for him to scope the place out before heading back downstairs. He wants to be included in everything, including showers. He will slam through the door to hop in the shower with whoever is in there.
