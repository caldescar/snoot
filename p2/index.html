          <h3>I have a dog named Luke Carroll. He is stupid beyond belief. I love him so much. My mom, my sister, and I got him when he was only about 3-4 months old. We were his fourth home, which was surprising to us because he is one of the sweetest, cutest dogs ever.  However, he is not a dog without his own quirks.</h3>
