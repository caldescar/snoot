    I got a dog named Luke Carroll. He is an absolute rascal and scoundrel of a dog. I love him so much. We got him when he was only about 3-4 months old. We were his fourth home, which was surprising to us because he is one of the sweetest, cutest dogs ever. However, he is not without his own quirks, which I am more than happy to talk about.

    Lukey pookie is a golden retriever, german shepherd, austrailian shepherd mix. He looks a lot like a lab-- we don't know why. He's well over 60 pounds, and is still growing.

    He is very smart, but is in no way, shape, or form obedient. We spent a good amount of money on getting him trained. He can sit, heel, not bite, not jump, the works. However, Luke will only do any of his tricks if he knows that there's something in it for him. If he knows he's not going to get a treat for sitting or not jumping, he'll do it anyways.

    Luke is also very protective. He wants to know where everyone in the house is at all times. He won't rest unless my mom, my sister, and I are all in the same room. If someone's upstairs in the bathroom, he will ram his entire body into the door to get in. He gets nervous when he can't see everybody. If he can't get into a room that he suspects someone is in, he will cry and bark. We let him in only for him to scope the place out and dip. Luke will always take the lead during walks, but will periodically check behind himself to make sure that we're still behind him.

    Along with being protective, he was raised with just women, so he absolutely HATES when men come into the house. He will shout, growl, and be generally distressed with strange men entering our home. In public and at the dog park, he's an angel. He's never bitten or barked at anyone. In the house, he will bark up a storm if someone he doesn't like is in his territory.

    If Luke does like you, though, he is not afraid to show it. He believes that he is a lapdog, and even at 60+ pounds, he is absolutely right. He will sit directly on your lap with a chew toy and play with that while you watch TV. Occasionally, he'll get sleepy and decide to take a nap right on your legs. It's probably the best feeling in the world, even with the dead legs. Because he's still a puppy, he sleeps all the time and all over the place. He's a very affectionate doggie. His main goal is to love his people a whole lot.

    If his first goal is to love with his entire heart, his second goal is to test your love to him by doing the most obnoxious stuff anyone has ever seen a dog do. He refuses to close his mouth when he's done drinking water, so he leaves big puddles all over the kitchen floor and tracks water across the house. He will eat anything that is small and cloth-like in texture. He wants to be included in everything, including showers. He will slam through the door to hop in the shower with whoever is in there.
